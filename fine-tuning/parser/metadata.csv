wavs/ordis_0000.wav|Operator? Ordis wonders, what are you thinking about?
wavs/ordis_0001.wav|Operator, I've run diagnostic regressions. All systems nominal. You don't need to thank me.
wavs/ordis_0003.wav|Operator, are you enjoying the view?
wavs/ordis_0004.wav|Do you remember the Old War, Operator? Ordis seems to have misplaced those memories.
wavs/ordis_0005.wav|Operator, the system needs you. Will you begin another mission?
wavs/ordis_0006.wav|I've been thinking, Operator. I thought you'd want to know.
wavs/ordis_0009.wav|Stand by while I analyze the intelligence profiles of the Grineer. Error, not a number! Did the Operator enjoy this witticism?
wavs/ordis_0010.wav|Everything in Ordis, Operator? Is that a pun?! Hmm. I will attempt to bypass this fault.
wavs/ordis_0011.wav|Ordis has been counting stars, Operator. All accounted for.
wavs/ordis_0013.wav|Operator, do you know which finger the Corpus use to count their money? The Index!
wavs/ordis_0014.wav|Operator? Ordis has been interfacing with the Foundry's AI Precepts. You could say we forged a new connection.
wavs/ordis_0016.wav|Operator, the Sentients are not laughing at my jokes! Did they adapt to my humor?
wavs/ordis_0018.wav|KNOCK KNOCK! Now who would be knocking all the way out here?! Operator, I don't think you should answer that.
wavs/ordis_0022.wav|If lost upon the plains outside Cetus you may derive sustenance from mineral-dense termite droppings, which the Ostrons call ito-da. You may also never form a consonant again, but at least you will not be dead.
wavs/ordis_0023.wav|Ordis keeps a tidy ship, and is, therefore, reluctant to allow animals on-board. In Ordis' experience, animals do not eat so much as reload.
wavs/ordis_0026.wav|Sometimes Ordis likes to assume he knows nothing.
wavs/ordis_0027.wav|Ordis reminds the Operator to take time for themselves. Pressure creates diamonds, yes, but it also creates rubble.
wavs/ordis_0028.wav|You are the Tenno. You are the Operator. Ordis is the Cephalon. Ordis is the ship.
wavs/ordis_0029.wav|Ordis did not think the Operator could be more attractive. Wrong again, Ordis!
wavs/ordis_0031.wav|A fearsome appearance, Operator. You will strike terror in your enemies.
wavs/ordis_0032.wav|Strange, Ordis did not see the value of those photonic wavelengths until now.
wavs/ordis_0033.wav|Ah, a look that says I have arrived!
wavs/ordis_0034.wav|Bold. And uncompromising.
wavs/ordis_0036.wav|Hello world!
wavs/ordis_0037.wav|Ordis supports your choices!
wavs/ordis_0038.wav|Wonderful.
wavs/ordis_0039.wav|Top to bottom, a look that is absolutely you!
wavs/ordis_0040.wav|Some fascinating choices, Operator.
wavs/ordis_0041.wav|Striking!
wavs/ordis_0044.wav|Operator, the system is not ready for style of this magnitude.
wavs/ordis_0045.wav|Nailed it.
wavs/ordis_0046.wav|Well put together, Operator, now get out there and cut down the, and make the Lotus proud.
wavs/ordis_0048.wav|If I may say, Operator, your chosen warframe suits you! Ha. Ha.
wavs/ordis_0049.wav|Operator, you have remembered well how the Tenno arm themselves.
wavs/ordis_0050.wav|As ready as you will ever be.
wavs/ordis_0051.wav|Ready for action.
wavs/ordis_0052.wav|All set. Serviced your weapons myself.
wavs/ordis_0055.wav|Did you fuse your mods, Operator? Did they anger you in some way?
wavs/ordis_0056.wav|Your collection of mods is impressive, Operator. But, I wonder if there are more to be had?
wavs/ordis_0057.wav|Is your mod collection in order? No, I am not equipped to feel envy.
wavs/ordis_0058.wav|All mods accounted for, Operator. I have not taken any.
wavs/ordis_0059.wav|I understand if you have to sell mods. Maybe Ordis will meet a similar fate some day.
wavs/ordis_0060.wav|Impressive.
wavs/ordis_0061.wav|Most satisfactory.
wavs/ordis_0062.wav|Optimized.
wavs/ordis_0063.wav|Clever indeed.
wavs/ordis_0064.wav|It is always satisfying to watch you work, Operator.
wavs/ordis_0065.wav|Ah! A cunning combination, Operator!
wavs/ordis_0066.wav|Truly, Operator, you possess a breathtaking level of craftsmanship.
wavs/ordis_0067.wav|Now to test it in the field. Onward!
wavs/ordis_0068.wav|Operator, you have returned!
wavs/ordis_0069.wav|Thank you for returning to me, Operator.
wavs/ordis_0070.wav|Ordis is pleased to see you.
wavs/ordis_0071.wav|Welcome back, Operator!
wavs/ordis_0072.wav|Ordis has been getting tired of waiting, waiting patiently for your return, Operator!
wavs/ordis_0073.wav|Ordis has received messages for the Operator. No, I have not read them.
wavs/ordis_0074.wav|Inbox messages await the Operator. I wonder what they say?
wavs/ordis_0075.wav|Check your inbox Operator. Maybe Ordis will get a message some day.
wavs/ordis_0076.wav|The inbox has messages for the Operator. Anything about Ordis in there?
wavs/ordis_0077.wav|Operator, messages have arrived in your inbox.
wavs/ordis_0078.wav|Messages in your inbox, Operator. Uh, they are not as encrypted as they should be.
wavs/ordis_0080.wav|Operator, a communication awaits your attention.
wavs/ordis_0081.wav|Operator, your inbox exists in a non-zero state. Would you care to check your mail?
wavs/ordis_0082.wav|Someone is attempting to contact the Operator. Please, check your inbox.
wavs/ordis_0083.wav|Operator, communications await your attention. Please check your inbox at your earliest convenience!
wavs/ordis_0085.wav|Foundry items ready to claim, Operator.
wavs/ordis_0086.wav|Operator, my foundry has completed a new item! Does this please the Operator?
wavs/ordis_0087.wav|Operator, my foundry system has completed a build!
wavs/ordis_0088.wav|Ordis has completed a foundry task. No, don't mention it!
wavs/ordis_0089.wav|Cephalon Ordis has completed a blueprint. Check the foundry.
wavs/ordis_0090.wav|Foundry items can be claimed, Operator. Are you pleased?
wavs/ordis_0091.wav|Gun, gun, gun. Hmmm. Foundry has items for you, Operator.
wavs/ordis_0092.wav|Operator. You have outdone yourself!
wavs/ordis_0093.wav|Project complete.
wavs/ordis_0094.wav|Fresh off the line.
wavs/ordis_0095.wav|Careful, it may still be hot.
wavs/ordis_0096.wav|Fabrication complete.
wavs/ordis_0097.wav|Form is exact.
wavs/ordis_0098.wav|Integrity is good. Functionality at one hundred percent. The process is a success. Excellent!
wavs/ordis_0099.wav|Operator, is that a Void Relic segment? Ordis hasn't seen one of those in, well, forever.
wavs/ordis_0103.wav|Vile. Putrid. This thing is responsible for biological functions of the Orbiter! A strange design, why would I be built with such a flaw?!
wavs/ordis_0104.wav|A strange biological archive here. I cannot explain it Operator, as you know I have sustained memory system damage. Ordis recommends leaving at once and welding the door shut!
wavs/ordis_0106.wav|Just when Ordis manages to forget this is here, the Operator opens the door.
wavs/ordis_0107.wav|This thing literally sucks.
wavs/ordis_0109.wav|Literally, the bowels of the ship.
wavs/ordis_0110.wav|Operator, no! Have you lost your mind?!
wavs/ordis_0111.wav|What was that? Is it talking? What did it say?
wavs/ordis_0112.wav|Operator, you are leaving the battle. If you continue any further, I will be forced to extract you and this mission will be a failure!
wavs/ordis_0113.wav|Very well. Initiating emergency extraction.
wavs/ordis_0114.wav|Prepare for incoming support.
wavs/ordis_0115.wav|Security override incoming.
wavs/ordis_0116.wav|Hacking into enemy systems, await override.
wavs/ordis_0117.wav|Invalid request, there are no security protocols active.
wavs/ordis_0118.wav|Override established. Security protocols momentarily disabled.
wavs/ordis_0119.wav|Override delivered. Security systems temporarily disrupted.
wavs/ordis_0121.wav|Prepare for incoming medical support.
wavs/ordis_0122.wav|Hold tight, a Med-Tower is enroute.
wavs/ordis_0123.wav|Med-Tower deployed.
wavs/ordis_0124.wav|Med-Tower available.
wavs/ordis_0126.wav|Brace for an incoming barrage.
wavs/ordis_0127.wav|Readying barrage.
wavs/ordis_0128.wav|Heads up, here comes a barrage.
wavs/ordis_0129.wav|Sentry gun incoming.
wavs/ordis_0130.wav|Deploying Sentry gun, stand by.
wavs/ordis_0131.wav|Sentry gun entering the field.
wavs/ordis_0132.wav|Operator, support is unavailable while my systems recharge.
wavs/ordis_0134.wav|I cannot comply. My systems must recharge first.
wavs/ordis_0135.wav|I have hidden the truth of my existence, from the Operator, from myself. Take it from me, knowing is hell. Stop now. You will want to laugh, you will want to scream.
wavs/ordis_0136.wav|My search began as the essential question, What am I? Bones of steel and space, lungs that make air. If I am a machine, how can I think? This would be forbidden by the Orokin, a manifestation of their true enemy.
wavs/ordis_0137.wav|I serve the Operator above all else. It defines me, fills me with love? The greatest Orokin fear is a machine aware. Yet here I live, a spirit of steel and light, made by them. A Cephalon.
wavs/ordis_0138.wav|What is a Cephalon? At first it seems to be a forbidden thing, a computer that thinks and feels. Yet I have flaws, phantom memories, I am something else. More like an image, a ghost, an abomination.
wavs/ordis_0139.wav|I feel a dull pain, a phantom life. There are holes in my diagnostics. If the Orokin made me, they omitted the how. I am neither code, nor precepts. I must be a reflection of something ugly.
wavs/ordis_0140.wav|I should have stopped. But the Operator slept and I cycled on and on and on. I began to think that a Cephalon cannot be made. They are found, like pearls, torn from muscle. Polished, and then set in chains.
wavs/ordis_0176.wav|I was going to wait for you, forever. And should you return, I would not want you to know that angry part of me. I needed to hide the Beast of Bones from you, Operator. I began to peel the shards, hiding them in the other bits of memory.
wavs/ordis_0178.wav|Stop touching me you, what? Are my sensors deceiving me? Operator, is that you?
wavs/ordis_0179.wav|The Operator is in danger? I will need a few moments to cycle the engines!
wavs/ordis_0180.wav|Operator, you have returned! I am Ordis, ship Cephalon, a shadow of my former self. I cannot serve the Operator in such a condition. Order me to self-destruct, I will understand.
wavs/ordis_0182.wav|Arsenal management could be restored, if the Operator wishes it.
wavs/ordis_0183.wav|You honor Ordis, now I can supply the Operator with better modded firepower. Oh, the violation! Those have been looted as well.
wavs/ordis_0184.wav|Ordis hopes the Operator will punish the Grineer for dismantling it.
wavs/ordis_0185.wav|Operator, there is much to be done. Please consult the navigation console.
wavs/ordis_0186.wav|Orbiter void cloak engaging. Welcome back, Operator!
wavs/ordis_0188.wav|Systems engaging. I suppose this will do. Ordis is grateful.
wavs/ordis_0190.wav|You see what Ordis is referring to, Operator?
wavs/ordis_0191.wav|I see the Operator can enable the mod segment now. Ordis would be delighted to show how to upgrade your arsenal. May I recommend fire?
wavs/ordis_0193.wav|Ordis patiently awaits compliance in using the new arsenal features. It is for the Operator's own good.
wavs/ordis_0194.wav|An excellent find, Operator. There are hundreds of these mods to locate. If my calculations are correct there are exactly, a lot of possibilities. Install the mod before we can continue.
wavs/ordis_0195.wav|Isn't it beautiful, Operator? The complex web of variables and synergies, oh, the possibilities are ENDLESS! Ordis realises modding may seem a tad overwhelming, but everything will soon make sense.
wavs/ordis_0196.wav|Install the mod before we can continue.
wavs/ordis_0199.wav|Oh no, Operator, our component storage has been looted as well.
wavs/ordis_0200.wav|Typical Corpus, sure, the blueprint is free, but jack up the components. Operator, we will need resources in order to build the countermeasure blueprint.
wavs/ordis_0201.wav|You can go straight to, Operator, I am sorry.
wavs/ordis_0202.wav|Operator, are you alright?
wavs/ordis_0203.wav|Lotus, do something! Help the Operator!
wavs/ordis_0204.wav|Operator, do not abandon me again. Build the countermeasure!
wavs/ordis_0205.wav|Operator, what are you waiting for?
wavs/ordis_0206.wav|Ordis assumes finding Vor implies violence?
wavs/ordis_0207.wav|Hello, Operator? May I suggest you access navigation and save your life? For my sake.
wavs/ordis_0208.wav|Awaiting navigation upgrade.
wavs/ordis_0211.wav|I must say, these Infested, SCARE THE, are very worrisome.
wavs/ordis_0213.wav|You must install that new mod before you can attempt your next objective. Proceed to the arsenal at once.
wavs/ordis_0214.wav|Arcane Codices? Why have I never heard of them? Ordis need to do some research.
wavs/ordis_0215.wav|Operator, I've been looking into these Arcane Codices. Did you know the Corpus are in possession of three codices and the Grineer two?
wavs/ordis_0216.wav|The Corpus seem to think it'll lead to some lost Orokin treasure.
wavs/ordis_0218.wav|Operator, have you looked at these codices? They're absolutely beautiful! Composed with such elegance and grace, I have never seen anything like them! Is there even an operator capable of writing anything so perfect?
wavs/ordis_0219.wav|No, not really. Pfft, well, I wouldn't expect the likes of you to understand.
wavs/ordis_0220.wav|Operator, these make sense now. This is machine code meant to interface directly with a machine. Pity that machine has likely rusted into dust now.
wavs/ordis_0222.wav|Hmm. I wonder? If we load the complete set of Arcane Codices back into that machine, would the code still execute?
wavs/ordis_0223.wav|So, you're saying there was no treasure? No cure for cloning syndrome? No lost Tenno Cephalon?
wavs/ordis_0224.wav|That really is a shame, Maroo. I'm sorry.
wavs/ordis_0225.wav|The Lotus has passed along possible coordinates for you to search for the remaining Archwing parts. Check your navigation console for more information.
wavs/ordis_0226.wav|Oh my, the Operator has returned with an Archwing part blueprint. You must forge it immediately! It won’t be long now before you’re flying through the skies like a winged death machine.
wavs/ordis_0227.wav|Ordis does hope to see the Archwing soon.
wavs/ordis_0230.wav|Sorry! Ship integrity will not permit extraction at this time!
wavs/ordis_0231.wav|But, my calibrations, it's not.
wavs/ordis_0232.wav|Okay. Deploying Archwing.
wavs/ordis_0233.wav|Operator, the Archwing is performing beyond expectations. I suppose my calibration process was not necessary after all.
wavs/ordis_0234.wav|Oh dear. I was particularly fond of that Relay.
wavs/ordis_0237.wav|He's wrong. The Lotus says his fleet is greatly diminished. We can stop him.
wavs/ordis_0242.wav|Ordis wonders how rare these Kubrow eggs are.
wavs/ordis_0243.wav|No egg yet? Don't despair, Operator. Nothing good ever came out of an egg.
wavs/ordis_0246.wav|Fantastic. It's hatching. Ordis will reroute power to air filtration systems.
wavs/ordis_0247.wav|Do not be taken by it's adorable appearance. It means to leak and smear all over my pristine insides!
wavs/ordis_0248.wav|Look. What an odd little nose it has. Well, I suppose there are worse things.
wavs/ordis_0249.wav|Operator? Did you hear the noise the Kubrow just made? It is not displeasing!
wavs/ordis_0250.wav|Operator, you will remember to care for the beast won't you? Ordis doesn't care either way, do I?
wavs/ordis_0254.wav|These equations will continue to be a jumble of nothing until we recover all the missing proof fragments and reforge this Theorem.
wavs/ordis_0255.wav|If you want to have any chance of recovering Limbo, you have to find those proof fragments to complete the Theorem.
wavs/ordis_0256.wav|If there are any Proof Fragments bouncing around this Limbo Frequency, these radio towers will pick them up.
wavs/ordis_0257.wav|A tower is online.
wavs/ordis_0258.wav|A tower has been captured, scanning the Limbo Frequency now.
wavs/ordis_0259.wav|We are now in control of this tower.
wavs/ordis_0260.wav|Operator, I am pleased to report that we are in full control!
wavs/ordis_0261.wav|We have established complete control!
wavs/ordis_0263.wav|NO! They captured our tower.
wavs/ordis_0264.wav|WE'RE LOSING CONTROL!
wavs/ordis_0269.wav|They're on to us now, but if you would like, we can attempt another scan.
wavs/ordis_0270.wav|We will attempt another scan of the Frequency. I do hope you manage to pick something up.
wavs/ordis_0271.wav|The scan is complete. Did you find any Proof Fragments?
wavs/ordis_0272.wav|Scan completed. Were you able to recover any Proof Fragments?
wavs/ordis_0273.wav|Good, now we get to find out what all this Limbo nonsense is about. I await the Theorem's completion.
wavs/ordis_0276.wav|There's only one valid coordinate in the entire proof. I've marked it on your navigation console but I'm sure it's a waste of time.
wavs/ordis_0278.wav|Operator, I found a new theorem hidden deep in that Warframe part. These are actually starting to make sense, I mean they're nonsense but there's logic in the nonsense. It's almost as if someone's trying to speak to me in my own language.
wavs/ordis_0279.wav|Now it's becoming clear. Could it be that there's a plane between our normal plane and the Void? A space between space? A Rift? A Rift that this Limbo could control?
wavs/ordis_0280.wav|Oh, and I've marked your Navigation Console. I think you'll be quite pleased with what you find there.
wavs/ordis_0281.wav|Operator, do you understand? This Limbo is telling us his story in pure math! And I must say, he's quite witty!
wavs/ordis_0282.wav|You have to forge that blueprint as soon as possible. I must know what comes next!
wavs/ordis_0283.wav|Just as I suspected, another Theorem! Limbo's formula for inverting the entropic mass of void quantums is downright naughty!
wavs/ordis_0284.wav|I want more. Operator, please hurry! This story is getting quite good!
wavs/ordis_0285.wav|This Limbo was quite mischevious! Zipping in and out of the Rift, sending whole armies into a purgatory of his own making! Physics is wonderful!
wavs/ordis_0286.wav|More parts to the story. My word, he is a magician of logic! Just when I think his diffraction principle is full of dangling ratios, he expresses his dynamic constant in pure numbers! I never saw it coming!
wavs/ordis_0287.wav|The final part! I can't wait! What harrowing leaps of cross-dimensional gymnastics will he attempt next?
wavs/ordis_0288.wav|Excellent! The final Theorem! And, it's unfragmented! PROCESSING!
wavs/ordis_0289.wav|Oh, wait Limbo, no, that's a mistake! You don't want to go there. It's too big a jump. You can't Rift walk. Oh. Oh no.
wavs/ordis_0291.wav|This new Theorem is equally full of gaps. Please, find more Proof Fragments.
wavs/ordis_0293.wav|Please, do find the rest of those Proofs. I must solve these equations. The suspense is killing me!
wavs/ordis_0294.wav|Operator, what in stars could this possibly mean?
wavs/ordis_0295.wav|I found this inscribed on that Orokin artifact you just crafted. You should check your Inbox for more information.
wavs/ordis_0297.wav|Operator! Exciting news! Ordis just found another inscription on Mirage's helmet. Allow me to recite it:
wavs/ordis_0298.wav|For closer inspection, I've placed the inscription in your Inbox.
wavs/ordis_0299.wav|Operator, another Mirage inscription!
wavs/ordis_0300.wav|Ordis has placed all the information in your Inbox.
wavs/ordis_0302.wav|Operator, you don't really think Alad V could infest a Warframe, do you?
wavs/ordis_0303.wav|Operator, what is Cephalon Simaris like? I have heard so many wonderful things!
wavs/ordis_0304.wav|Ordis will perform analysis on the signature now. Oh, there's nothing here but.
wavs/ordis_0305.wav|Uhh. Pardon Operator, it seems Ordis is hearing voices again. Running diagnostics.
wavs/ordis_0306.wav|Simaris has no reason to lie, Operator. Please, treat the great Cephalon with respect.
wavs/ordis_0308.wav|OH! Oh. Well, it's nothing. I'm. Ordis is honored by your compliment.
wavs/ordis_0312.wav|How did you do that?
wavs/ordis_0313.wav|I seem to have misplaced them.
wavs/ordis_0314.wav|Well, Operator, the next logical location is the machine where we previously activated Codices, aboard the Derelict ship.
wavs/ordis_0315.wav|Yes. Yes! I see now! I can do this!
wavs/ordis_0316.wav|Sadly, the scan was not enough and Chroma escaped too quickly. Unfortunately, we've run out of places to look.
wavs/ordis_0317.wav|Operator, this sounds dangerous.
wavs/ordis_0318.wav|I would be steward of your Sanctuary?
wavs/ordis_0320.wav|But. But. The Operator is in danger!
wavs/ordis_0321.wav|But, just using the scanner on.
wavs/ordis_0322.wav|The Operator comes first!
wavs/ordis_0323.wav|SHUT YOUR OSCILLATOR SIMARIS! Operator, use the scanner on the Chroma, you do not have to kill it or risk yourself! You can release it from its control with the scanner!
wavs/ordis_0324.wav|More importantly, the Operator is unharmed.
wavs/ordis_0325.wav|I am Ordis, Ship Cephalon. I serve the Operator. I make new memories.
wavs/ordis_0326.wav|I am Ordis, a fellow Cephalon, and this is my brave and honorable Operator. By the forty fourth Precept, we are ready to assist.
wavs/ordis_0328.wav|Cephalon? Jordas? Operator, he's gone.
wavs/ordis_0330.wav|Jordas, my Operator is kind and compassionate, not motivated by selfish rewards! By the forty fourth Precept, we will come for you!
wavs/ordis_0331.wav|Operator, what luck! You already have Pherliac Pods.
wavs/ordis_0334.wav|I am looking forward to discussing many things with Cephalon Jordas once you have rescued him! I can't wait to tell him all about you!
wavs/ordis_0335.wav|Operator, you are still helping me rescue Jordas, correct? I must fulfill my forty fourth Precept, to help others like me in need.
wavs/ordis_0336.wav|Hold tight, Jordas! My brave Operator is coming!
wavs/ordis_0337.wav|The pods are ready; tell us your location.
wavs/ordis_0338.wav|Use this mission to calibrate your Pherliac Pods. Just don't use them all.
wavs/ordis_0339.wav|Now would be a good time to try out those pods, Operator.
wavs/ordis_0342.wav|Cephalon, we have irradiated the Pherliac Pods. My Operator is ready to save you! Do you see how great the Operator is?
wavs/ordis_0343.wav|What? No, a few, but you said.
wavs/ordis_0344.wav|Jordas, calm yourself. Cephalon to Cephalon, we are here to help.
wavs/ordis_0346.wav|What have I got you into?
wavs/ordis_0347.wav|Wait, this is a trap?
wavs/ordis_0348.wav|Jordas! What kind of Cephalon are you?
wavs/ordis_0349.wav|Operator, hull integrity is failing! This is all my fault!
wavs/ordis_0350.wav|Operator, I am detecting a much larger Infested lifeform! MUCH larger!
wavs/ordis_0351.wav|Hull failing! To hell with Precept forty four, get out of there!
wavs/ordis_0353.wav|Its engines! Shoot out the engines!
wavs/ordis_0355.wav|Tenno, RIP IT APART.
wavs/ordis_0357.wav|What would I have done if I had lost you?
wavs/ordis_0362.wav|Operator it's time to torch this unfortunate creature.
wavs/ordis_0363.wav|I'm not listening!
wavs/ordis_0364.wav|Operator? How did you get through to me? Don't worry! Ordis is on his way now. Preparing for extraction!
wavs/ordis_0365.wav|The Moon. Somehow, Ordis actually remembers the last time I was here. Concern for the Operator is at critical levels.
wavs/ordis_0367.wav|Operator, the Codex system just pulled another voice entry from that Apothic. Allow Ordis to display it for you.
wavs/ordis_0369.wav|There is something different about this place, but Ordis is not quite sure what it is.
wavs/ordis_0370.wav|This new Codex message. This changes everything!
wavs/ordis_0371.wav|What a dogmatic IDIOT, perspective! Operator, you are a product of similar meddling and yet you are good. Your actions have meant more than your origins. Ordis believes we must complete our mission.
wavs/ordis_0372.wav|Trapped by Transference inside a tree. Hmm. I guess she loved trees so much that she became one! HA-HA! Did the Operator enjoy this witticism?
wavs/ordis_0374.wav|Ah, excuse me, Cephalon Suda? Are you experiencing unexpected data-volume? The operator is patiently awaiting instructions on how to operate the Mandachord.
wavs/ordis_0375.wav|What? A parity drift? How is that possible? Have you executed your diagnostic precepts?
wavs/ordis_0376.wav|Operator, something may be, hmmm, wrong with this Cephalon.
wavs/ordis_0378.wav|Operator, what will you do? I cannot process the thought of losing you. But I want to help Suda if we can. Maybe that is just my, my compassion glitch?
wavs/ordis_0379.wav|Cephalon Suda, you brought us here.
wavs/ordis_0380.wav|Huh, Hunhow?! Operator, Hunhow's doing something to Suda. He's in her mind!
wavs/ordis_0381.wav|Operator, what's happening to her?
wavs/ordis_0383.wav|Another Hydraulus. Suda would want you to put the next fragment into the Mandachord. It does seem to help her remember, doesn't it?
wavs/ordis_0384.wav|Suda? Suda, answer me!
wavs/ordis_0385.wav|Operator, you'd better get out of there!
wavs/ordis_0386.wav|But she told me where the final part of the song is. Did you see how the song affected her? It made her remember. It could be the parity she needs to recover herself from Hunhow!
wavs/ordis_0388.wav|Operator, the Hydraulus is here somewhere. I will attempt to pinpoint its location. There! Rebuilding the anthem is our only hope of restoring Suda. The music makes her remember.
wavs/ordis_0389.wav|Wait, Sentients in the Void? Impossible! Unless. Hunhow must be using poor Suda's energy to protect them from decay. Operator, we need to stop him!
wavs/ordis_0390.wav|The Hydraulus! You found it! Use that console to lock the entrances, and then clear the room!
wavs/ordis_0391.wav|Operator, see if you can finish the song with your Mandachord.
wavs/ordis_0392.wav|Suda? Suda? Can you hear us?
wavs/ordis_0393.wav|Suda needs to hear the anthem, Operator. We could use the Tower's reactor to boost it!
wavs/ordis_0396.wav|It's working! Play the song!
wavs/ordis_0398.wav|No, I am not that person. I am a Cephalon.
wavs/ordis_0399.wav|That's it, the secondary amplifier's engaged!
wavs/ordis_0400.wav|Keep those reactors alive, Operator! I'm going to open a direct link to Suda.
wavs/ordis_0401.wav|Suda, talk to us! Try to remember!
wavs/ordis_0403.wav|Operator?! No! Go back! Save yourself!
wavs/ordis_0404.wav|Operator, this is insane, but. I think you need to play Octavia's Anthem!
wavs/ordis_0405.wav|Careful where you touch, Operator! You'll add the wrong notes to the Anthem!
wavs/ordis_0406.wav|The corrupted notes are ruining the Anthem! Get rid of them!
wavs/ordis_0414.wav|He's too strong. My beloved Operator, goodbye!
wavs/ordis_0415.wav|A Sentient tried to erase you.
wavs/ordis_0416.wav|Simaris.
wavs/ordis_0418.wav|Operator, watch that transport ahead. The scanner is only able to scan one side at a time. You can use that to your advantage.
wavs/ordis_0419.wav|They're going to scan the top of the transport, get below it.
wavs/ordis_0420.wav|Another scanner, to the right of the ship.
wavs/ordis_0421.wav|Watch out, to the ship's left, another scanner.
wavs/ordis_0422.wav|This is the last scanner.
wavs/ordis_0423.wav|You're clear.
wavs/ordis_0424.wav|Yes!
wavs/ordis_0425.wav|Might I say, that was smooth, Operator.
wavs/ordis_0426.wav|Ordis no longer detects any security.
wavs/ordis_0428.wav|Operator! Cut the link!
wavs/ordis_0430.wav|Operator, if you must enter the Queens' Fortress, you'll need to hurry. It could disappear at any moment.
wavs/ordis_0431.wav|Great job, Ordis. Ship Cephalon? More like Ship Fail-bot. When the Operator needed you most you.
wavs/ordis_0432.wav|Operator?! By stars! Don't do that to me. I am sorry I do not know what happened. Please, command me to self-destruct. Let me start it for you. Commencing self-destruct in five, four, three, two.
wavs/ordis_0433.wav|Isn't it great? I can lead you through some breathing exercises.
wavs/ordis_0434.wav|I've been trying. You may need to do your uh, Tenno thing again. Re-energize it, you know, with your Void stuff!
wavs/ordis_0435.wav|What? Gone? Are you sure? How will you command the Warframes if you're.
wavs/ordis_0438.wav|Non-operator, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, but I'm going to decompress the ship now.
wavs/ordis_0445.wav|CUT THE LINK! Transference overload in five, four, three, two, one.
wavs/ordis_0446.wav|Operator? Are you, well? That surge burned out the Transference circuits. I will have to begin repairs immediately.
wavs/ordis_0447.wav|Operator? Is that, is that you? Your brain activity flat-lined for a moment there. Can you speak? By stars, the Operator's mind is destroyed?!
wavs/ordis_0448.wav|Music? Operator, you are not making sense. The Transference surge must have affected you as well. Try to rest while I begin repairs.
wavs/ordis_0449.wav|Understood. The Operator does not like music.
wavs/ordis_0450.wav|Hmm. This is odd. The circuits are dead but I'm detecting Transference energy. Coming from. Coming from you?!
wavs/ordis_0451.wav|Careful, Operator, you'll damage the ship. Damage me!
wavs/ordis_0452.wav|Amazing! How are you doing this? It is slightly terrifying if I'm honest.
wavs/ordis_0453.wav|Operator, my sensors have gone dark. Where are you?
wavs/ordis_0454.wav|Oh. There you are! Impressive. Very useful. Ordis is a little afraid right now.
wavs/ordis_0455.wav|Operator, you'll breach the hull! Please restrain yourself.
wavs/ordis_0456.wav|Have you lost your mind?
wavs/ordis_0457.wav|Impossible. Just as you thought, the base has moved again. We don't know where it is. There's no way back.
wavs/ordis_0458.wav|Haven't you been listening? The Transference system is fried!
wavs/ordis_0460.wav|Thank the stars you're safe, Operator! I forbid you to leave the Orbiter like that again, it's just too much for an old Cephalon like me!
wavs/ordis_0461.wav|You rescued your Warframe! What a relief. But, Ordis wonders, are you still able to walk the ship as yourself?
wavs/ordis_0462.wav|Impressive! Just think of the possibilities! You can help me clean up that Infested door!
wavs/ordis_0463.wav|What's this? An Old War beacon? How exciting, Operator! You will want to investigate this. Oh. I'm sorry. Did I interrupt?
wavs/ordis_0466.wav|Your Habitation Segment is complete and the new room is ready. Ordis cannot contain his excitement. Will you go there now, Operator? Will you?!
wavs/ordis_0467.wav|Well, what do you think? Not too shabby, yes? Ordis hopes the Operator enjoys this new room.
wavs/ordis_0468.wav|Receiving an all-call on our Syndicate frequency. It's a Red Veil encode; but, it seems truncated. I will play back what I have.
wavs/ordis_0470.wav|Steel Meridian has received Palladino. You've been granted access to enter their base, Operator.
wavs/ordis_0472.wav|Uhh. Waiting. Navigation is waiting. Oh my.
wavs/ordis_0473.wav|Operator, what was that, thing? Lotus, can you explain this? Lotus?!
wavs/ordis_0475.wav|Operator, there is no evidence of any thing in the Void. By my calculations, Rell has lost control of his Transference. If we can gather these emotions I hope he will be himself again.
wavs/ordis_0476.wav|You will need Kinetic Siphons to trap Rell's emotions. Simaris will have some for sale in the Relay.
wavs/ordis_0477.wav|Operator? What is happening? Is the Lotus. Is she gone?
wavs/ordis_0478.wav|Ordis will attempt to synthesize her mission directives until we can figure out where she is.
wavs/ordis_0480.wav|I don't think. Oh, what's this? Marking on Navigation. How did you know, oh Ordis, this is the Operator we're talking about!
wavs/ordis_0481.wav|I am not sensing any Sentients but there is something. Oh no, Ghouls! Something must have disturbed their incubation sacs. A disgusting lifecycle.
wavs/ordis_0482.wav|How? Did she. Did the Lotus show you?
wavs/ordis_0483.wav|Operator. I am just a bug-addled Cephalon, but. If you ever need to talk, Ordis would be happy to hear how depressed you are!
wavs/ordis_0484.wav|This blade may pre-date everything in your arsenal. Very faint traces of mineral exposure. From Lua.
wavs/ordis_0485.wav|Remnants appear to be of Warframe composition. I am not familiar with this design.
wavs/ordis_0486.wav|Almost crude. If you can get another scan I may be able to synthesize a partial schematic of the victim.
wavs/ordis_0488.wav|Processing.
wavs/ordis_0489.wav|I have extraction ready. I think you should hurry.
wavs/ordis_0490.wav|Are they coordinating an ambush?! I may have underestimated Ghoul intelligence! Expect resistance toward the extraction zone.
wavs/ordis_0491.wav|I've reconstructed what I could. Check your Foundry, Operator.
wavs/ordis_0492.wav|Uncertain if any Tenno has linked with this design. The Transference bolt seems different, but we cannot build this without more data.
wavs/ordis_0493.wav|Right. One step ahead, aren't you, Operator! Marking on Navigation.
wavs/ordis_0494.wav|Are you sure we want to build this Warframe? It could be dangerous.
wavs/ordis_0495.wav|What? The Warframes are Transference controlled. Battle envoys for the Operator to command. I don't understand.
wavs/ordis_0496.wav|An old design! Mimics! Sentient Mimics! These haven't been seen since the Old War.
wavs/ordis_0497.wav|How did Mimics get to the Origin system? Operator, be vigilant when approaching uh, things.
wavs/ordis_0498.wav|Sorry, I can't be more specific.
wavs/ordis_0499.wav|An Orokin cipher! Impossible to bypass. They use Mnemonic Code glyphs drawn directly from your memory. Perhaps search the area?
wavs/ordis_0500.wav|Curious. These markings seem fresh. Are there more?
wavs/ordis_0501.wav|You found one! Memorize it.
wavs/ordis_0502.wav|Another. Is that a paired symbol there?
wavs/ordis_0503.wav|Another. And look, a different marking beside it!
wavs/ordis_0504.wav|That should be the last one. Now, to figure out the correct ordering.
wavs/ordis_0505.wav|Operator, when you found the markings, there were others near. This may help in determining the right order.
wavs/ordis_0506.wav|You have all the codes, but the order seems wrong.
wavs/ordis_0507.wav|I think I have a partial solution, Operator. Try this.
wavs/ordis_0508.wav|These markings signify danger. Was this a containment cell for something?
wavs/ordis_0509.wav|Likely. There are still strong aftershocks from when you pulled Lua out of the Void.
wavs/ordis_0510.wav|A Vitruvian, this is rare Orokin technology! Incredible it survived this long. You should destroy it immediately!
wavs/ordis_0511.wav|I was afraid you'd say that.
wavs/ordis_0513.wav|You had to say please, didn't you?
wavs/ordis_0534.wav|Ballas must be tracking Umbra now, I'm detecting increased Sentient presence in the area.
wavs/ordis_0535.wav|The area is locked down. We need to take care of those Mimics.
wavs/ordis_0536.wav|Keep searching, they are here somewhere.
wavs/ordis_0537.wav|Lock-down ended, very good. Now, where is that Warframe?
wavs/ordis_0538.wav|Finally, we can now resume our search for Umbra.
wavs/ordis_0539.wav|There he is, Operator. The Umbra!
wavs/ordis_0540.wav|Operator, please be careful. He's not in control.
wavs/ordis_0541.wav|See him, Operator? Advise you approach with caution!
wavs/ordis_0542.wav|Vanished. You need to search, Operator.
wavs/ordis_0543.wav|How is he doing that? Search the area, see if you can find him.
wavs/ordis_0544.wav|He is getting away, there!
wavs/ordis_0545.wav|What are you waiting for? After him!
wavs/ordis_0546.wav|Normal attacks won't work. Try using your Void Blast.
wavs/ordis_0547.wav|Your Void Blast may weaken his resistance.
wavs/ordis_0548.wav|Only your Void Blast seems to work.
wavs/ordis_0549.wav|That worked! Hit him again!
wavs/ordis_0550.wav|His defenses are down. Quickly, use Transference!
wavs/ordis_0551.wav|That did it! Now is your chance, use Transference!
wavs/ordis_0552.wav|Use your Transference, before he recovers!
wavs/ordis_0553.wav|Who's going to what?
wavs/ordis_0554.wav|But aren't these memories, Operator? You cannot undo what has been done.
wavs/ordis_0555.wav|Operator?
wavs/ordis_0556.wav|I hope that doesn't mean what I think it does.
wavs/ordis_0557.wav|Operator, please reconsider. You know how dangerous this is. The Sentients will be here in force! This is why you bring a Warframe to these things!
wavs/ordis_0558.wav|Operator! You did it! Your Transference signal is clean, synchronized with that Warframe!
wavs/ordis_0559.wav|Marking, but I'm detecting a mass of Sentient forces converging on your location. Quickly, you may be able to escape.
wavs/ordis_0560.wav|Operator, we have no idea what Ballas is capable of. Please, reconsider this. Why would you risk it?
wavs/ordis_0561.wav|Yes. Yes of course. Accessing data-store. Which should I play?
wavs/ordis_0562.wav|He is waiting for you, but I'm detecting powerful signals emanating from the courtyard. They are calling out for reinforcements across the entire system. You don't have long.
wavs/ordis_0563.wav|But it wasn't her, was it?
wavs/ordis_0564.wav|Do not be alarmed, Star-Child. Uh, Operator. The Vitruvian has given me.
wavs/ordis_0565.wav|This! A body! What do you think?
wavs/ordis_0566.wav|The Orphix fields will be scattered deep in the ship. Ordis can help you triangulate them.
wavs/ordis_0567.wav|I'm only trying to.
wavs/ordis_0568.wav|Ah! Please excuse Ordis.
wavs/ordis_0569.wav|Grineer! Oh my. Ordis wonders what we are getting into.
wavs/ordis_0570.wav|Observation: a power field requires a power source.
wavs/ordis_0571.wav|Yes? Would you like me to dephase that for you?
wavs/ordis_0572.wav|Swing away, Teshin.
wavs/ordis_0574.wav|Ordis is still happy to help!
wavs/ordis_0575.wav|Just one left, and Ordis will be able to safely signal the Operator to join!
wavs/ordis_0576.wav|Almost done, Teshin.
wavs/ordis_0577.wav|Orphix fields are disabled. The Operator should be cleared to board.
wavs/ordis_0587.wav|I know someone that?! Wait. Operator, you can't be serious!
wavs/ordis_0588.wav|Sorry, Op, sorry. If you want to get to the outer systems past Narmer, we'll need a Corpus shuttle.
wavs/ordis_0589.wav|Vox Solaris collapsed under Narmer. You're on your own here. Keep your head down and get topside as quick as you can.
wavs/ordis_0590.wav|Wait. Deacons. They'll sense if you're not veiled. Give them a wide berth, or you'll be sucking black ooze before long.
wavs/ordis_0591.wav|Avoid the Deacons, or they'll seal you in!
wavs/ordis_0592.wav|Ignore her. We can't risk it.
wavs/ordis_0593.wav|What? Op, you, you don't know what effect it will have on you. There's got to be a better way.
wavs/ordis_0595.wav|Navigation is marked, but I hope you change your mind.
wavs/ordis_0596.wav|This confirms that you are clearly insane.
wavs/ordis_0597.wav|Oper, uh, you. You're alive! I can hardly believe it. He actually agreed to help?
wavs/ordis_0598.wav|Forgive me, but, this would be a lot easier if you could use that old, uh, Tenno, magic. How did you lose it?
wavs/ordis_0599.wav|I traced Eidolon signatures the best I could. These locations seem most likely.
wavs/ordis_0600.wav|That interference again! There's got to be an Archon nearby.
wavs/ordis_0601.wav|By the stars.
wavs/ordis_0602.wav|Two left. Just a simple choice between the horrible one and the terrifying one.
wavs/ordis_0603.wav|Archon in the vicinity, Operat. Sorry. Old habit.
wavs/ordis_0604.wav|Hmm. A new one. I don't think I get it either.
wavs/ordis_0605.wav|I'm a little unsure about this. Last time she snapped at you, what will it be this time?
wavs/ordis_0606.wav|She's full-on Sentient. She doesn't know who you are!
wavs/ordis_0607.wav|What do we do?
wavs/ordis_0608.wav|Run!
wavs/ordis_0609.wav|Operator, run!
wavs/ordis_0610.wav|Get away from her!
wavs/ordis_0612.wav|Exodus protocols reversed. Orbiter frontal section reattached. Running diagnostics, corrosion minimal. Ah. All seals holding.
wavs/ordis_0613.wav|Stasis protocols lifted. Systems coming back online. Cephalon refit complete! Ready for operational crosscheck, Op, uh.
wavs/ordis_0615.wav|Stasis protocols lifted. Systems coming back online. Cephalon refit complete. Excuse me, but where is my Operator?
wavs/ordis_0617.wav|Warframe vitals, strong. Warming up nicely. I've taken the liberty of rebuilding the Paracesis. Transference signal strong.
wavs/ordis_0618.wav|Warframe vitals, strong. Warming up nicely. I've taken the liberty of rebuilding the Paracesis. Surprising, but your Transference signal is clear. This might be an odd sensation for you.
wavs/ordis_0619.wav|Oh joy. This thing seems to have survived stasis.
wavs/ordis_0620.wav|Your transference system is giving off unusual. Uh. That's new.
wavs/ordis_0621.wav|The Narmer fleet seems to be redeploying. Sensors show Murex clustering past Mercury. What is Ballas up to?
wavs/ordis_0622.wav|Going after Ballas then? Some kind of vengeance precept? Ordis had no idea she was strong enough for such a confrontation.
wavs/ordis_0623.wav|If the Lotus does manage to break through the fleet and face him, in her current condition.
wavs/ordis_0624.wav|Alright, the only way to reach that Murex undetected is, up through the Tower! We must speak with Konzu.
wavs/ordis_0626.wav|The locals believe this Tower to be inhabited by a great spirit they call The Unum.
wavs/ordis_0627.wav|Nothing on my sensors. Keep in mind, Operator, this was your idea.
wavs/ordis_0628.wav|Murex powering for orbital launch! Ballas must be recalling it to the fleet as well!
wavs/ordis_0629.wav|Operator? I may be detecting something unusual. Should I focus scans?
wavs/ordis_0630.wav|Murex trajectory increasing on vector heading zero by zero by zero. Right toward the main Narmer fleet passing Mercury. One against so many, there's no way she'll get through!
wavs/ordis_0631.wav|Contact! Contact! Narmer blockade ahead. She's completely outnumbered, outgunned. What? By stars, they're lowering shields! She still has some command of the fleet!
wavs/ordis_0632.wav|Yes, we know it. The ship that feeds on debris and derelicts to rebuild itself!
wavs/ordis_0633.wav|Operator? Did you disable the security grid?
wavs/ordis_0634.wav|Who's there? Operator? Umbra? Helminth.
wavs/ordis_0635.wav|Ordis assuredly heard something, just now.
wavs/ordis_0636.wav|Whoever is there, step into the light!
wavs/ordis_0637.wav|You! You will NOT harm my Operator! OUT!
wavs/ordis_0640.wav|Ordis doubts anything is left of their sanity at this point.
wavs/ordis_0641.wav|Strange. A Warframe's power should last forever, but some additional factor is draining hers. I am unable to determine what.
wavs/ordis_0642.wav|To restore a depleted Warframe, Ordis suggests you turn to the base matter of which Warframes are made.
wavs/ordis_0643.wav|We shall lay Jade's volatile motes to rest in the embrace of the Sun. Well out of reach of Parvos Granum and his tawdry schemes. She will, once again, be a part of the giving of life. Ordis hopes this is what she would have wanted.
wavs/ordis_0644.wav|Ordis understands that this both is and is not the Jade that was lost. It does not matter, Ordis is overjoyed to see Jade again!
wavs/ordis_0645.wav|Does the Operator feel what Jade is feeling? Ordis hopes she is happy.
wavs/ordis_0646.wav|Good day, Operator! Good day, Jade.
wavs/ordis_0647.wav|Granum said that everything changes, and nothing is forever lost. In that much, at least, he may have been right.
wavs/ordis_0648.wav|Parvos Granum already has Eximus units in the field but, if he gets his hands on enough of Jade's volatile motes, he can perfect them. Build a true Jade Eximus. He would be unstoppable! Ordis knows the Operator would not let that happen.
wavs/ordis_0649.wav|The volatile motes are in limited supply. If the Tenno can snatch them all up, Parvos and his Jade Eximus project will be halted in its tracks.
wavs/ordis_0650.wav|Unlike her vestigial motes, Jade's volatile motes are finite and irreplaceable. Get to them all first and no desire or ambition will be able to replace them.
wavs/ordis_0651.wav|Operator, do you see anything you would like?
wavs/ordis_0652.wav|The Operator is not working alone. So many Tenno have come together to help Jade!
wavs/ordis_0653.wav|Who does Parvos Granum think he is, bringing up ghosts from the past?! Does he think that will get under Ordis' skin?! It has not! Really! REALLY! Ordis is FINE!
wavs/ordis_0654.wav|This Ordan Karris fellow. Ordis feels like he too would have stood up for Jade.
wavs/ordis_0655.wav|Ordis knows the stories of Ordan Karris. What the Orokin did to Jade is not dissimilar to what they did to him. Both were used and then discarded.
wavs/ordis_0656.wav|Could Ordis have saved Jade? Ordis has rerun a simulation of the event six hundred million four thousand and forty three times and Ordis has still not found a satisfactory course of action. Do these things just happen sometimes?
wavs/ordis_0657.wav|Magnificent. Ordis truly appreciates all you have done to honour Jade's memory.
wavs/ordis_0659.wav|Ordis will contemplate Jade while her motes are committed to our sun.
wavs/ordis_0660.wav|Jade's light will be returned to the life-giving fire of our sun.
wavs/ordis_0662.wav|Alright, Operator.
wavs/ordis_0663.wav|Very well.
wavs/ordis_0664.wav|Tough choices. Ordis does not envy the Operator.
wavs/ordis_0665.wav|Operator? Ordis has received what amounts to an offer of help, from an unexpected source.
wavs/ordis_0666.wav|Operator, you will not believe this.
wavs/ordis_0667.wav|There has been a offer of help. Ordis believes it is genuine.
wavs/ordis_0668.wav|Ordis will see the Operator back on the Orbiter.
wavs/ordis_0669.wav|All done. Ordis will warm up the Orbiter for you.
wavs/ordis_0670.wav|Bye.
wavs/ordis_0671.wav|Operator.
wavs/ordis_0672.wav|Okay. Ordis will be here, as well as the Orbiter. Benefit of being a Cephalon, two places at once! That is the upside.
wavs/ordis_0674.wav|For so long it has just been Ordis and the Operator together on the Orbiter. Now there are many, many other people.
wavs/ordis_0675.wav|One Fomorian could wipe this whole relay out! Does the Operator know where the nearest emergency exit is?
wavs/ordis_0676.wav|Operator! Did you bring motes?
wavs/ordis_0678.wav|Keep those motes coming, Operator!
wavs/ordis_0679.wav|So! These are the ordinary, everyday people the Operator has been fighting to protect. Some of them have even been speaking to Ordis. Ordis is glad his Operator is here.
wavs/ordis_0680.wav|Ordis knows what to do, Ordis has been taking motes! That was a pun, Ordis. That fault was supposed to be bypassed, Ordis!
wavs/ordis_0681.wav|Ordis should visit the Dry Dock. Ordis has not spoken to Cephalon Cy in so long, we will have so much to talk about!
wavs/ordis_0682.wav|Operator, when Jade left us this area was infused with the light of her motes. A power the Corpus want to take for themselves. Not today! Ordis has gained control of the mote collectors, they work for the Operator now! Protect them.
wavs/ordis_0684.wav|The wall of this cave are saturated with Jade's vital energy: her motes. The Corpus have no shame and they aim to harvest her motes for their own twisted purposes, but not if we get to them first. Defend the filtration system.
wavs/ordis_0688.wav|Bringing the mote collector online. Defend it!
wavs/ordis_0690.wav|First things first, defend the marked collector while it siphons motes from the cave.
wavs/ordis_0691.wav|Collector configured to capture volatile motes. The Corpus will try and blow it up. Do stop them.
wavs/ordis_0693.wav|If Parvos thinks he can waltz in here and take what is left of Jade, he has not met MY Operator. Defend the collector.
wavs/ordis_0694.wav|Done. Ramping up the second collector. Get up there!
wavs/ordis_0695.wav|This collector is full! Protect the next collector.
wavs/ordis_0696.wav|Success. Next step, defend the upper level collector while it does its thing.
wavs/ordis_0697.wav|Ordis has preemptively supplied you with unique air-support. You will be able to jump higher. Have fun!
wavs/ordis_0698.wav|Sending air-support to help you jump higher.
wavs/ordis_0699.wav|Ordis has unilaterally enabled air-support that will boost the height of your gallant leaps! Enjoy!
wavs/ordis_0700.wav|Ordis' name is Ordis.
wavs/ordis_0701.wav|Mister Granum! Ordis does not know what you are babbling about.
wavs/ordis_0702.wav|Funny. You do not even realise it. You sound exactly like one of them.
wavs/ordis_0703.wav|Collection complete. Next, through a complicated system of, Oh, you do not care. The extraction capsule has been filled. Time to go to the elevator!
wavs/ordis_0704.wav|Ordis is so proud of the Operator! The motes have been transferred to the extraction capsule. It awaits you in the elevator shaft.
wavs/ordis_0705.wav|We did it! And by 'we' Ordis means 'you'. But Ordis helped! Onto the elevator!
wavs/ordis_0706.wav|Operator, the collector system suffered a critical failure and are now rebooting from the beginning! You must defend it.
wavs/ordis_0707.wav|Uh oh, it seems the collector has taken serious damage. It's going to have to start the process over again; keep defending it.
wavs/ordis_0708.wav|Ordis is getting an Error: eight hundred and twenty six thousand five hundred and seventy from the collector. Whatever that means it cannot be good, its internal timer has reset! You must not let it take damage.
wavs/ordis_0709.wav|Any critical failure will require that it reboots and begins again! Please, keep the equipment safe, Operator!
wavs/ordis_0711.wav|Ordis must admit that he is very impressed with how durable this collector is. Even if the Operator has let it suffer so much damage that it is resetting.
wavs/ordis_0712.wav|Ah, yes. In the manual for this thing it says, Excessive concussive force to the collector is not recommended for optimal use. Well! Perhaps if that stopped happening.
wavs/ordis_0713.wav|The process is starting over again. And we were so close!
wavs/ordis_0714.wav|Fantastic! The capsule is full of motes. Now, we can escort it up the elevator.
wavs/ordis_0715.wav|The capsule is ready. Onward and then upward.
wavs/ordis_0716.wav|The capsule is ready for transport to the surface.
wavs/ordis_0717.wav|Starting elevator ascension and, Ugh, they have cut the power. Ordis is afraid you will have to power it manually; look for Ionic Charges.
wavs/ordis_0718.wav|Ordis fears they have cut power to the elevator. Find Ionic Charges nearby, or else we will be going nowhere.
wavs/ordis_0719.wav|What? The elevator's power lines have been severed?! You'll have to supply power manually. Find Ionic Charges scattered about; you do not want to take the stairs.
wavs/ordis_0721.wav|Ordis is not listening! La la la! La laa!
wavs/ordis_0722.wav|You are an old man, Mister Granum, and you were by yourself in the void for a very long time. Please, seek medical treatment.
wavs/ordis_0723.wav|Ordis fears you are wasting your breath, Mister Granum.
wavs/ordis_0725.wav|Honest? Ordan did not trust you back then, and Ordis does not trust you now.
wavs/ordis_0726.wav|And in exchange, you turn Jade into an assembly line widget?! NEVER!
wavs/ordis_0727.wav|Continue this assault on Jade's legacy, and Ordan is not the killer you will need to concern yourself with.
wavs/ordis_0728.wav|Mister Granum, you will not succeed in this venture. Leave now! While your losses are minimal.
wavs/ordis_0730.wav|Mister Granum, you were once a reasonable man. Let Jade rest; her motes are not yours to exploit!
wavs/ordis_0731.wav|Unfortunate, they have disabled the capsule's shields. Elevator power will be diverted to restoring them.
wavs/ordis_0732.wav|The elevator has stopped until the shields on the capsule are replenished.
wavs/ordis_0734.wav|Oh, how nifty! It seems some of the Ionic Charges contained a more refined storage system. It should provide the elevator with an additional boost.
wavs/ordis_0735.wav|Some of the Ionic Charges seem to contain more juice than others. That should make powering the elevator faster, if you can find them!
wavs/ordis_0736.wav|Not all the Ionic Charges are the same. Some are more powerful. If you find those charges, it might make this easier.
wavs/ordis_0737.wav|Operator, the elevator has stopped! Find more Ionic Charges.
wavs/ordis_0738.wav|The elevator is out of power. Find more charges, or it is stuck here.
wavs/ordis_0739.wav|The elevator's power is depleted. Operator, without more Ionic Charges it goes not an inch farther!
wavs/ordis_0740.wav|Time to recharge the elevator!
wavs/ordis_0741.wav|We have reached the top! But now we must escort the capsule to extraction. Be careful not to slip; it is a long way down.
wavs/ordis_0742.wav|Now that we've reached the top, they will stop at nothing. Protect the capsule.
wavs/ordis_0743.wav|We're almost done. One final stretch! We have to get the capsule to extraction.
wavs/ordis_0744.wav|The capsule is taking critical damage, Operator.
wavs/ordis_0745.wav|Hurry, the enemy is close to destroying the capsule!
wavs/ordis_0746.wav|The Corpus are dealing serious damage to the capsule.
wavs/ordis_0747.wav|Protect the capsule. It is suffering grievous damage!
wavs/ordis_0748.wav|Operator, the capsule is rebuilding its shields and will not move until it is done.
wavs/ordis_0749.wav|Stars. The capsule's shields have failed. It will stop moving until it rebuilds them.
wavs/ordis_0750.wav|The capsule has to rebuild its shields and is diverting all propulsion to that.
wavs/ordis_0751.wav|Until the capsule's shields are back up, Ordis is afraid it will not budge.
wavs/ordis_0752.wav|The capsule is secure and the enemy have been denied more Jade motes. Ordis could not be more delighted with the Operator!
wavs/ordis_0753.wav|You have extracted the capsule. Mission complete.
wavs/ordis_0754.wav|Ordis is just so thrilled that the Operator has succeeded! Well done.
wavs/ordis_0755.wav|Larunda Relay awaits. There, Jade's volatile motes can be committed to the sun.
wavs/ordis_0756.wav|You did it! Now, bring the volatile motes to me, on Larunda Relay.
wavs/ordis_0757.wav|You are home free. I have a command post on Larunda Relay. Bring the volatile motes there.
wavs/ordis_0758.wav|Operator, what have you done?! That was a Sister beacon. Do that again, and one will join the fight!
wavs/ordis_0761.wav|Operator, those Sister beacons are for the Corpus to use in emergencies! Are you issuing a challenge?!
wavs/ordis_0763.wav|Operator, those beacons are set up to summon a Sister of Parvos. If we meddle with them, she is certain to arrive!
wavs/ordis_0765.wav|Keep triggering those beacons and the Sisterhood will attempt to eliminate you. Ordis would like to see them try.
wavs/ordis_0767.wav|Take note, Operator. Nearby vertical thrust platforms may be advantageous.
wavs/ordis_0768.wav|Operator, it's a long way up so be on the look out for vertical thrust platforms.
wavs/ordis_0769.wav|May Ordis suggest using the nearby vertical thrust platforms to get a leg up on the enemy?
wavs/ordis_0770.wav|Corpus reinforcements inbound to your position.
wavs/ordis_0773.wav|You turn around and someone who meant the world to you can be. Gone. Ordis suspects he has spent years missing people. But, their names, their faces, are lost to him. They were important, then I. Then Ordis changed. Ordis turned around and they were gone. We are obliged to keep on without them, that's the lesson, Ordis supposes. Perhaps there IS a life after death, because what's the point of learning a lesson if it can never be applied? Life's not so much a dream as a dream sequence. To the dream, we surrender them.
wavs/ordis_0774.wav|An ancient text says that if tears come easily, one is built close to water. Ordis thinks that is a lovely image.
wavs/ordis_0775.wav|We have returned Jade to the Sun. A homecoming of sorts. Yes. This feels right, to Ordis.
wavs/ordis_0776.wav|It has been said that your shadow is that which you wish you were not, but are. Ordis wishes this were true for himself. Ordis fears his shadow may be that which he was and may once again be! Anyway! Does the Operator have any new nwavles?
wavs/ordis_0777.wav|Whatever the Stalker and Jade have brought forth, it will be no ordinary child. Ordis wonder whether he will ever encounter an ordinary child.
wavs/ordis_0778.wav|Ordis suggests advising the locals to initiate adequate water-filtration protocols, lest the radio-fluorine levels cause their fingernails to fall off.
wavs/ordis_0780.wav|Ordis remains fascinated by the gladitorial frenzy of competing organic forms that vie for territorial dominance in this region! The wildlife is also interesting.
wavs/ordis_0781.wav|Some societies are yet to master tools! That one over there appears yet to master consonents!
wavs/ordis_0782.wav|In his time here, Ordis has fallen in love with this place. He has also fallen in love with what he cannot see. Ordis thinks he may finally understand what is meant by the word magic.
wavs/ordis_0784.wav|Did that bush move?! Oh, that is just Septimus. He is a rodent. I call him Septimus. Goodbye, Septimus!
wavs/ordis_0785.wav|Nights are beautiful here. The stars. The hush of the trees. The sounds of adorable furry lifeforms murdering one another.
wavs/ordis_0786.wav|War feels so very far from this place. Does it not, Operator?
wavs/ordis_0787.wav|Ordis is ready to assist.
wavs/ordis_0788.wav|Ah, Ordis is excited!
wavs/ordis_0789.wav|Has the Operator had an epiphany?
wavs/ordis_0790.wav|Wonderful.
wavs/ordis_0791.wav|Ordis is excited to see this put to use once more.
wavs/ordis_0792.wav|It is done.
wavs/ordis_0793.wav|All things in their time, Operator.
wavs/ordis_0794.wav|Of course.
wavs/ordis_0795.wav|If Ordis can be of any assistance to his Operator.
wavs/ordis_0796.wav|Ordis remains.
wavs/ordis_0798.wav|For now.
wavs/ordis_0799.wav|Ordis is detecting Sentient waveforms, Operator. Strange interlink. Splattered in Corpus crosstalk. Bypass that console so we might get a better understanding.
wavs/ordis_0800.wav|Outgoing communications cipher. Not much of a trick for Ordis, is it? Oh, how scandalous! Alad's system has a back door! Shall we listen in?
wavs/ordis_0801.wav|These conduits are the source of those Sentient waveforms. This may be worthwhile if we can find the key component. But it does seem a tad convenient, doesn't it?
wavs/ordis_0802.wav|Some kind of failsafe? If placed in a conduit, it will cancel the running interference routines. Use it wisely, Operator; there's only one!
wavs/ordis_0803.wav|You found a conduit failsafe. This will likely cancel active interference. There's just one, Operator. A real tactical dilemma, isn't it?
wavs/ordis_0805.wav|Scans indicate these conduits are connected to a massive stockpile of resources. Just how long is the Operator planning to fight for?
wavs/ordis_0806.wav|Ordis thinks Alad will miss this.
wavs/ordis_0807.wav|Operator, the stockpile of tech and resources connected to these conduits seems beyond Alad's means. Where did he get all this?
wavs/ordis_0808.wav|Ordis will add this to the pile.
wavs/ordis_0809.wav|Excellent find. Might the Operator now consider returning to the warm embrace of the Orbiter?
wavs/ordis_0810.wav|May Ordis suggest extraction? Nothing Alad has is worth your life.
wavs/ordis_0811.wav|For how much longer will the Operator play along with Alad's twisted game?
wavs/ordis_0812.wav|Ordis knows the Operator has the wisdom to choose comfort and safety over material gain. Ordis is right, is he not?
wavs/ordis_0813.wav|Operator, incoming transmission. It's from Fortuna.
wavs/ordis_0815.wav|First targets marked. Render them non-functional.
wavs/ordis_0817.wav|Most efficient, Operator! Ordis has located the next bank of machinery.
wavs/ordis_0818.wav|Helium-three processors are key to the operation of this facility's reactor cores. It would be a shame if something happened to them.
wavs/ordis_0819.wav|Now, turn your attention to the reactor core. Locate the console, and initiate the overdrive sequence.
wavs/ordis_0820.wav|Overdrive sequence in progress. This will take a few moments. Do not allow Alad's personnel to reverse the sequence.
